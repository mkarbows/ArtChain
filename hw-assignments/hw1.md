##### 1.1 What are the basic tasks that all software engineering projects must handle?
The basic tasks that must be handled are: gathering requirements, high-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and wrap-up.

##### 1.2 Give a one sentence description of each of the tasks you listed in Exercise 1.
Gathering the requirements is to learn what the customer wants and needs.
High-level design involves describing the major pieces of the application and how each of these pieces interact with one another.
Low-level design means providing more detail about how to build the pieces of the application so programmers can implement them.
Development is when the code is written to implement the application.
Testing requires using the application under different circumstances to try and detect any flaws or bugs.
Deployment is when the application is made available to the users.
Maintenance is when bugs are fixed, and when additions, enhancements and future version of the program are made.
Wrap-up involves evaluating the project's history to determine what went right and wrong in order to avoid the bad things and repeat the good things in the future.

##### 2.4  
Did it!!  

##### 2.5 What does JBGE stand for and what does it mean?  
JBGE stands for Just Barely Good Enough, meaning you basically shouldn't write any more code documentation or comments than necessary.  

##### 3.2 Use critical path methods to find the total expected time from the project's start for each task's completion. Find the critical path. What are the tasks on the critical path? What is the total expected duration of the project in working days?  
The critical path is G -> D -> E -> M -> Q. The total expected length for the project is 32 working days.  

##### 3.4 Build a Gantt chart for the network you drew in Exercise 3. [Yes, I know, you weren't assigned that one — however, when you do Exercise 2 you should have enough information for this one.] Start on Wednesday, January 1, 2020, and don't work on weekends or the following holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, and President's Day.

##### 3.6 In addition to losing time from vacation and sick leave, projects can suffer from problems that just strike out of nowhere. Sort of a bad version of deus ex machina. For example, senior management could decide to switch your target platform from Windows desktop PSs to the latest smartwatch technology. Or a strike in the Far East could delay the shipment of your new servers. Or one of your developers might move to Iceland. How can you handle these sorts of completely unpredictable problems?  
One way to handle the issue of "lost time" is to expand the time estimate for each task by some amount. Another way to deal with unpredictable problems would be to add some tasks to the project to specifically represent lost time and sick time. Problems like having supplies delayed, for example, can be avoided by planning and adding tasks to the schedule for approvals, order leads and setup of supplies.  

##### 3.8 What are the two biggest mistakes you can make while tracking tasks?  
The first biggest mistake you could make while tracking tasks is to ignore an issue and hope the developer makes up for it in the future. The second biggest mistake is to assign more developers to a task than what is needed just to try and reduce the time needed to finish the task.  

##### 4.1 List five characteristics of good requirements.  
Clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, and verifiable are 5 characteristics of good requirements.  

##### 4.3 list the audience-oriented categories for each requirement. Are there requirements in each category? [If not, state why not…]  
a. Business  
b. User and functional  
c. User and functional  
d. User and functional  
e. Nonfunctional  
f. Nonfunctional  
g. Nonfunctional  
h. Nonfunctional  
i. Nonfunctional  
j. Functional  
k. Functional  
l. User and functional  
m. User and functional  
n. User and functional  
o. User and functional  
p. User and functional  
The only category without requirements is implementation because you might need to buy new hardware/network bandwidth to support the application, but since it is assumed that you're performing uploads and downloads, you might already have everything needed.  

##### 4.9 Brainstorm this application and see if you can think of ways you might change it. Use the MOSCOW method to prioritize your changes.  
Instead of having the program only tell the user if they have won or lost, the program could calculate a score to increase the competition factor of the game (S priority). That being said you would want to probably make something to keep track of the user's previous scores so they can aim to beat them (S priority). Going off of this, the program could allow users to guess the whole word at once to increase the points they receive (C priority). Lastly, the program could report high scores of the user's so they can view their opponents high scores, for example (W priority).
