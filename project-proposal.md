ArtChain is a distributed application that allows users to upload original photographs and films to a gallery and gaining proof of work and unbeatable security. ArtChain's software is based on Ethereum's blockchain and will use Ethereum's smart contracts to provide user's works of art with proof of work and ownership. ArtChain's features will include encrypting photographs and storing them on the blockchain. There is an application that is similar that utilizes blockchain technologies to allow users to upload and share their digital art with others on a social-media-type platform. Additionally, Kodak just came out with their own cryptocurrency that allows artists to license original work and sell accordingly through blockchain technologies. ArtChain is different than both of these applications because the end goal of this application is to convert it into a node module/package that can be installed on applications/personal websites that will ensure security on user's art on their websites/applications. ArtChain will be powered by Ethereum (potentially switching to EOS in the future), Angular 4, and BigchainDB. The end user of ArtChain is an artist interested in storing and displaying their art in a secure way. ArtChain will focus on photographers first so they are able to upload and distribute their photographs with confidence.  

This project is appropriate for this class for many reasons. Knowledge of both the backend and frontend and everything that each entail will be utilized in the creation of this application. My existing knowledge will be expanded tremendously just be trying to understand blockchain technologies. This application will push this farther by helping me learn how to implement a decentralized application. I will also be exploring steganography and how it may benefit my application in the form of validating artist's original work. There is a very large learning curve with this project but I plan to take things as they come. I plan on working on this application even after graduating so my main concern is implementing the feature that stores the image on the blockchain. There are a good amount of tutorials and stackoverflow resources available to me, and I already have the necessary skills to make this application a possibility.
