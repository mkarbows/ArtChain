ArtChain is a decentralized application that allows users to verify original photographs on the blockchain. ArtChain is going to be based on Ethereum's blockchain. Users will send an image file to ArtChain, ArtChain will then utilize Ethereum's smart contracts to provide the image with a unique hash and/or a timestamp that will then be tagged to the photo or encrypted on the photo file. A transaction will then be made to the blockchain with the images's unique hash within the transactions metadata. Once the transaction has been verified on the blockchain, the user can make as many copies of the newly tagged/encrypted photo and display or distribute this photo as they please. ArtChain will allow users the peace of mind that their images are registered and validated before they display them. This means they will always have proof that the image is their piece of art. Steganography may be implemented as the method of encryption on the actual image itself. ArtChain will be powered by Ethereum, Angular4 and potentially other libraries to facilitate encryption and hashing. The target user is an photographer that is interested in displaying their photographs without the fear of losing credit for them. In the future, ArtChain will hopefully expand to all types of artists ranging anywhere from musicians to film makers.  

ArtChain is appropriate for this class for many reasons. Not only will I be utilizing all of my knowledge from previous classes, but I will be learning a whole new technology. Understanding the blockchain and all that it enables us to do will be key to this project. Additionally, I will gain more experience with hash functions and algorithms along with encryption. Photos, their data, and pixels will be studied to put together a tagging feature or steganography approach to encrypting or attaching more data to the image itself. I will go through a large learning curve with this project but the tools and tutorials needed to succeed are within reach. In general, knowledge and understanding on how blockchain technologies work, and especially how to implement these technologies, are extremely beneficial at the moment.
